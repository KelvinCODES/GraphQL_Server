1. Solved circular references in graphql types

    wrap fields with () => (


    ), so that the function will not run until the whole file has been defined


2. Query Fragments

...companyDetails

fragment companyDetails on Company {
  id
  name
  description
}

3. Look at queries and mutations to see what I can do to the data

4. Apollo Client and Apollo Provider to work with react view layer

5. graphql-tag to write queries in javascript files,

  gql `<Query goes in here>`

6. graphql from react-apollo to bind components with queries
